# Python for Finance: Beta and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

This project explores the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** using Python. It is designed to help finance students and professionals understand the theory and apply the CAPM formula programmatically using real stock data.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn

- The intuition and theory behind the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- How to calculate **Beta** and **Expected Returns** of individual stocks
- Visualizing financial data interactively using **Plotly Express**
- Working with **pandas** and **yfinance** to fetch and manipulate historical stock data

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `yfinance` for fetching financial data
- `plotly.express` for interactive visualizations
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `matplotlib` for plotting

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository

- `Finance_101_Capital_Asset_Pricing_Model_(CAPM).ipynb` â€” The main Jupyter notebook with theory, code, and visualizations
- `stocks_dataset.csv` â€” The sample stock data used for CAPM analysis

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered

- Market risk vs. individual risk
- Beta coefficient and its interpretation
- Security Market Line (SML)
- Risk-free rate, Market return, and Expected return
- CAPM Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f)
  \]

## ðŸ“ˆ Output Example

- Beta calculation for stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and S&P 500
- Interactive time series plots of stock prices
- CAPM-based expected return estimation
